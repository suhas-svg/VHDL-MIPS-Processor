# VHDL-MIPS-Processor
 This project implements a 32-bit MIPS processor in VHDL, featuring essential components such as an ALU, register file, and control unit. It supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set for arithmetic, logical, memory, and control flow operations. The design has been verified through simulation using ModelSim and is ready for synthesis .
